## 🧭 Engineering Direction

I am intentionally building toward becoming an engineer trusted with **large-scale intelligent systems.**

My focus sits at the intersection of:

- Applied Artificial Intelligence  
- Backend Architecture  
- Scalable System Design  
- Automation Infrastructure  

> Not chasing trends. Building irreversible skill.

## 🛡️ Sentinel-AI — Intelligent Moderation Infrastructure

**Flagship Engineering System**

A multi-language AI moderation platform engineered to detect and process harmful content across:

✔ Text  
✔ Audio  
✔ Images  
✔ Video  

### Why This Matters
As digital platforms scale, moderation becomes critical infrastructure — not a feature.

This system is being designed with **production-level thinking**, emphasizing reliability, automation, and horizontal scalability.

### Engineering Depth

• Machine learning inference pipelines  
• API-first backend architecture  
• Automated decision workflows  
• Scalable service design  
• Observability and logging  

> Built like infrastructure — not a classroom project.

## ⚙️ Core Engineering Strength

### Primary Stack
- Python  
- FastAPI  
- REST Architecture  
- MongoDB / Database Design  
- Machine Learning Integration  

### Expanding Into
- Distributed Systems  
- Cloud Infrastructure  
- Model Optimization  
- High-scale backend design  

Depth compounds. I optimize for long-term engineering leverage.

## 🚧 Currently Engineering

- Advanced AI moderation pipelines  
- Production-ready ML workflows  
- Scalable backend services  
- Deep system design capability  

Trajectory matters more than speed.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

• Build for scale — even when starting small  
• Prefer clarity over cleverness  
• Ship → measure → iterate  
• Optimize for compounding skill  

Good engineering is invisible…

until it fails.
